# CloudCenterJavaAPI

Used to interface with Cisco Cloud Center via Java API.
Primary motivation currently is to enable Cloud Center usage in DevOps scenarios:
- build and publish services
- build full application stacks
- run test cases on those dynamically created applications
- integrate to CI/CD tools workflows like Jenkins Pipeline
